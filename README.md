First of all, I will try to be brief for you to customize or copy this dotfiles. be careful with *.share* this folder exist because when i tried arch linux for the first time i never saw the directories structure, and i created thinking is the right place for the wallpapers, conclusion: NO, just move the wallpapers and change the corresponding paths in the config files.
Another notes: Some scripts are made in python (eww notify) but i dont know if is stable.

And thats all, have fun customizing homie :)
